# Neighborhoodmap


Google Map API:
1) We declare the application as HTML5 using the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration.
2) We include the Maps API JavaScript using a script tag.
3) We create a div element named "map-canvas" to hold the Map.
4) We create a JavaScript object literal to hold a number of map properties.
5) We create a JavaScript "map" object, passing it the div element and the map properties.
6) We use an event listener to load the map after the page has loaded.
